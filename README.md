# Student_Prediction-Model
The goal of this notebook is to predict studentsâ€™ exam scores based on study habits and lifestyle factors (e.g., hours studied, social media usage, attendance, etc.) using Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.
ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset (student_performance_regression.csv) contains the following key features:

hours_studied â†’ Time spent studying.

sleep_hours â†’ Average daily sleep.

attendance_pct â†’ Class attendance percentage.

prev_gpa â†’ Previous GPA.

practice_tests â†’ Practice test performance.

tutorials_watched â†’ Extra study material consumed.

social_media_hrs â†’ Time spent on social media.

exam_score â†’ ðŸŽ¯ Target variable (final exam score).


1. Simple Linear Regression (One Feature)

First model: hours_studied â†’ exam_score.
Trained model & extracted slope (coefficient) and intercept.
Visualized with scatter plot + regression line.
Second model: social_media_hrs â†’ exam_score
Again trained model, extracted slope & intercept.
Visualized with scatter plot + regression line.

Interpretation:
More hours studied â†’ higher predicted score.
More hours on social media â†’ lower predicted score.


2. Multiple Linear Regression (Two Features)

Used both hours_studied & social_media_hrs to predict exam_score.
Performed train-test split (80/20).
Fitted model and generated predictions for both training and testing data.
Extracted model parameters:
Intercept (offset)
Coefficients (slopes for each feature)

3.ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation(Regression Metrices)

Metrics were calculated for both training and testing sets:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error) â†’ average error in predictions.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) â†’ typical error size in exam score units.
RÂ² Score â†’ proportion of variance explained by the model.
